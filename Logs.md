- Searched for videos relating to Karate framework
- Found this video to be most helpful "Karate DSL: API Automation and Performance from Zero to Hero
". I could not find any other video where I could understand the accent better than this one.
- Installed Maven, yarn, and two other test projects from a resource that was provided in the video
- After sometime in the tutorial I got curious as to what would happen if I tested the endpoint for the springboot app
- It took some time to make it work. It happens that the Karate project can't see other feature files if it isn't in the orginal package as it is in. It must just be because I don't know that much Java. But one thing that's for sure is I can rename the pre made classes for testing and add other scenarios within it.

- Continued with the video just only up to the part where the intructor introduced environment variables
- echo $? use this to check if the process return 1 for error or 0 for succesful return like no excpetions were thrown
